## Node-RED basic flow

Node-RED already has many different connectors to implement multiple kind of flows. For example, it can act as a web server to provide a service. In the following example, it provides a flow to compute the sinus of an angle provided in the http request's parameters:

The flow can be reached using the NodeRed host name and the path /sinus:
http://<flowId>.<accountId>.apivalley.org/sinus?q=32151.1

## Node-RED basic functional tester

The same principle can used to validate the web service. A flow can be embedded in the same flow as a new tab or can be a flow on its own.

Now, a request to the service can be generated by clicking on the "Start Request" inject node. It capacity to generate traffic is very limited and not flexible.

## ApiFlows load tester

The basic functional tester can be enhanced to generate a traffic on demand, based on From those base flows, we can enrich the tester to capture some metrics and/or generate traffic for numerous different contexts objects.

## ApiFlows load tester : step 1

Send an Injector message to start a request:

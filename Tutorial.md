## Node-RED basic flow

Node-RED already has many different connectors to implement multiple kind of flows. For example, it can act as a web server to provide a service. In the following example, it provides a flow to compute the sinus of an angle provided in the http request's parameters:

The flow can be reached using the NodeRed host name and the path /sinus:
http://<flowId>.<accountId>.apivalley.org/sinus?q=32151.1

## Node-RED basic functional tester

The same principle can used to validate the web service. A flow can be embedded in the same flow as a new tab or can be a flow on its own.

Now, a request to the service can be generated by clicking on the "Start Request" inject node. It capacity to generate traffic is very limited and not flexible.

## ApiFlows load tester

The basic functional tester can be enhanced to generate a traffic on demand, based on From those base flows, we can enrich the tester to capture some metrics and/or generate traffic for numerous different contexts objects.

## ApiFlows load tester step 1

Send an Injector message to a wire-in node to start a request:

This requires to send one Injector message for each request sent to the service.

## ApiFlows load tester step 2

Using an Injector message from a wire-out node to a wire-in node allows the traffic to continue:

For each context injected, there will be one request per second in this example.

## ApiFlows load tester step 3

For now, the request sent to the service is always the same. The context can be used to store and update data related to a context. For example, the current angle can be stored in the context to remember which sinus was already computed. It can be incremented during the next context loop.

A metrics node can be used to store a metric value in time-series database for further analysis. For example, it can be a counter incremented for each sinus computed.

A metric node can also be added to the service to count and validate that the number of requests sent on one side was well proccessed on the other.
